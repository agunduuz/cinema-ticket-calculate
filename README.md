# 🍿"Let's go to the movies!🎬 

Click on the link below to explore my project called 'Cinema Ticket Calculator'.
I used 
- **HTML**, 
* **CSS**,  
+ **JavaScript** for this project.  <br/>

To ensure you don't forget which seats you've chosen, I've implemented Local Storage. Now you can comfortably forget about it!

I wanted to add some color to my Cinema Company because it gives the feeling of colors embracing each other in the interface.
If you encounter any "ERRORs," please let me know.


You can access the live version of the project through the following link: [Link to Cinema Ticket Calculate](https://cinema-ticket-calculate.vercel.app/) 🌍


See you in the next project!" 🎟️🎥
